### Known Issues üêõ

#### Recently Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Unpacking Error**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - ValueError in `find_selfimprove_eval_logs()` function (commit 4b346cb)
- **Setup Automation**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Created comprehensive setup script with error handling
- **Environment Management**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - .env file support for secure API key configuration
- **Credential Resolution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Docker container credential issues resolved by switching to OpenRouter API
- **LLM Configuration**: ‚úÖ **UPDATED** - Fixed `llm.py` and `llm_withtools.py` to properly handle OpenRouter API calls
- **Tool Calling**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Corrected OpenRouter tool calling format and message conversion for Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **API Compatibility**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Full compatibility between Docker containers and OpenRouter API established (for basic calls like model listing).

#### Remaining Technical Challenges
- **Context Length**: Some tasks exceed model context limits.
- **Stochasticity**: Handling non-deterministic evaluation results.
- **Empty Patches / LLM Call Failure**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTIVE DEBUGGING** - `client.chat.completions.create()` calls to OpenRouter/Anthropic models are failing silently or with unhandled errors from within Docker containers.
- **Symptom**: `model_patch.diff` is empty, `self_evo.md` only contains the user prompt.
- **Current Action**: Added specific `try-except` logging in `llm.py` around the failing call to capture detailed error information.
- **Next Step**: Run DGM to trigger this new logging and analyze the output.
- **Compilation Failures**: Self-modified code that doesn't compile.

#### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **API Rate Limits**: Claude and OpenAI API constraints
- **Docker Requirements**: System-level dependencies
- **Computational Resources**: High CPU/memory requirements for evaluation
- **Network Dependencies**: External API and repository access

### Success Metrics üìà

#### Research Goals
- **Self-Improvement**: Agents successfully modify their own code
- **Performance Gains**: Measurable improvement over baseline
- **Generalization**: Improvements work across different tasks
- **Safety**: No harmful self-modifications observed

#### Technical Metrics
