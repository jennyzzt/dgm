# Active Context - Darwin Gödel Machine

## Current Project State
**Status**: System ready for execution with comprehensive LLM configuration
**Phase**: LLM configuration overhaul complete, ready for cost-optimized experiments
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-30

## Current Focus
Debugging persistent LLM non-response for `client.chat.completions.create()` calls from within DGM-managed Docker containers, specifically when using OpenRouter with Anthropic models. The goal is to identify the exact error or cause of the silent failure.

## Recent Work Completed

### LLM Call Debugging (2025-05-30)
- **Symptom**: `model_patch.diff` files are empty, `self_evo.md` only contains the user prompt, indicating no LLM response for the main coding task.
- **Verification**:
    - Docker image builds successfully.
    - Disk space issues resolved.
    - Diagnostic script (`diagnose_openrouter.py`) within the container successfully:
        - Accesses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
        - Initializes `openai.OpenAI` client for OpenRouter.
        - Makes successful `client.models.list()` calls to OpenRouter.
    - Increased `openai.OpenAI` client timeout in `llm.py` to 300s.
- **Problem Isolation**: The issue is specific to the `client.chat.completions.create()` call, as simpler API interactions work.
- **Action Taken**: Added enhanced `try-except` block around the `client.chat.completions.create()` call in `llm.py` (for OpenRouter/Anthropic path) to log any specific exceptions.
    - File modified: `llm.py`
- **Next Step Interrupted**: Attempted to run DGM with the new logging, but encountered command-line argument errors for `DGM_outer.py`. Identified that task/model specification arguments are not directly handled by `DGM_outer.py`.

### LLM Configuration Overhaul (Previous)
- **Unified Configuration**: Made all four LLM roles independently configurable via environment variables
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Added support for unified API access through OpenRouter
- **Cost Optimization**: Enabled cost-effective model selection (O3-mini for diagnosis/evaluation)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in README, FAQ, and .env.example
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Critical Bug Fix (Previous)
- **Issue**: ValueError in `prompts/self_improvement_prompt.py` - unpacking 4 values into 3 variables
- **Root Cause**: `find_selfimprove_eval_logs()` returns 4 values but was being unpacked into 3
- **Solution**: Updated both function call and `process_selfimprove_eval_logs()` to handle all 4 return values
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### Setup Infrastructure Completed (Previous)
- **Automated Setup**: Created `setup.sh` with comprehensive error handling
- **Environment Management**: .env file support for secure API key management
- **Docker Verification**: Confirmed Docker permissions and container functionality
- **Dependencies**: All Python packages installed successfully in virtual environment
- **Git Configuration**: Updated .gitignore to exclude memory-bank/ and .roo/ directories

### System Verification (Previous)
- **DGM Launch**: Successfully started evolutionary self-improvement process
- **Container Creation**: Confirmed Docker containers launching for parallel tasks
- **API Integration**: Multiple LLM providers now supported (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock, DeepSeek)
- **Benchmark Access**: SWE-bench and Polyglot datasets accessible

## Active Decisions

### System State
- **Runtime Status**: DGM system is functional but encountering a specific LLM call issue.
- **Bug Resolution**: Previous critical bugs resolved. Current focus is on the LLM non-response.
- **Infrastructure**: Complete setup with Docker, APIs, and dependencies verified.
- **Documentation**: Memory bank fully established.

### Current Priorities
1. **Resolve LLM Call Issue**: Identify and fix the root cause of `client.chat.completions.create()` failures.
2. **System Execution**: Run DGM with the fix to confirm normal operation.
3. **Monitoring**: Track system performance.
4. **Analysis**: Examine results from self-improvement cycles.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Tomorrow - 2025-05-31)
1. **Execute DGM with Enhanced Logging**: Run `DGM_outer.py` (with corrected command-line arguments, likely removing task/model specifics as they are not direct args) to trigger the new error logging in `llm.py`.
2. **Analyze Logs**: Examine `self_improve.log` (and any stdout from the DGM run) for specific errors caught by the new `try-except` block in `llm.py`.
3. **Implement Fix**: Based on the logged error, implement the necessary fix (e.g., adjust `httpx` settings, modify request payload, handle a specific exception type).
4. **Verify Fix**: Re-run DGM to confirm patches are generated.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit all resolved code and updated memory bank files to GitHub.

## Key Learnings

### Bug Resolution Process
- **Error Pattern**: LLM API call failures can be subtle, especially within nested execution environments like Docker. Simple API calls (e.g., listing models) succeeding doesn't guarantee more complex calls (e.g., chat completions) will.
- **Debugging Approach**: Iterative refinement of logging and diagnostics is key. Start broad, then add specific logging at suspected points of failure.
- **Git Workflow**: Proper commit messages with detailed change descriptions.
- **Safety Measures**: .gitignore updates to protect sensitive local context.

### System Architecture Understanding
- **Self-Improvement Pipeline**: DGM_outer.py → self_improve_step.py → coding_agent.py (which uses `llm.py` and `llm_withtools.py`).
- **Evaluation Flow**: Docker containers → benchmark execution → result analysis.
- **Prompt System**: Complex prompt generation with log analysis and diagnosis.
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple containers running concurrent self-improvement attempts.

## Current System Status
- **Operational**: All critical components functional, except for the specific LLM call issue.
- **Active Experiments**: Paused pending resolution of the LLM call issue.
- **Issue Identified**: Empty patch generation due to `client.chat.completions.create()` not returning a response or erroring silently within Docker.
- **Next Action**: Run DGM with enhanced logging in `llm.py` to capture specific errors.

## Current Issue Analysis
### LLM `chat.completions.create()` Failure (2025-05-30) - ACTIVE DEBUGGING
- **Symptom**: Self-improvement attempts generating empty `model_patch.diff` files. `self_evo.md` contains only the user prompt.
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: An unhandled exception or specific timeout is occurring during the `client.chat.completions.create()` call when using OpenRouter with Anthropic models from within the Docker container. This is despite simpler calls like `client.models.list()` succeeding.
- **Evidence**:
    - `self_evo.md` contains only user prompt, no LLM response.
    - `self_improve.log` shows "Using OpenRouter API with model anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet" but no subsequent error or successful patch.
    - Diagnostic script confirms basic API key access and `client.models.list()` functionality.
- **Debugging Step Taken**: Added a general `try-except Exception as e` block around the specific `client.chat.completions.create()` call in `llm.py` for the OpenRouter/Anthropic path to log the error type and message.

### Previous LLM Connection Issues (Largely Resolved)
- **Initial Misdiagnosis**: Believed to be task complexity.
- **Docker Env Var Fix**: Ensured API keys are passed during Docker container *creation* via `utils/docker_utils.py` and `self_improve_step.py`.
- **Docker Build Fixes**: Resolved `apt-get update` GPG errors in `Dockerfile`.
- **Disk Space Fix**: Resolved "no space left on device" with `docker system prune`.

### Changes Made (Today - 2025-05-30)
- **`llm.py`**: Added specific `try-except` block around `client.chat.completions.create()` for OpenRouter/Anthropic calls to improve error logging.

## Research Context
- **Evolutionary AI**: Self-modifying agents with empirical validation
- **Safety Research**: Containerized execution of untrusted code
- **Benchmark Integration**: Real-world coding task evaluation
- **Open Science**: Reproducible experiments with comprehensive logging
- **Failure Mode Research**: Empty patches are a known challenge requiring specific handling. Current debugging aims to distinguish LLM non-response from actual "no change needed" scenarios.
